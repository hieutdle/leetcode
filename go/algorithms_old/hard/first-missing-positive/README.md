# [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)

## Description

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```go
Input: [1,2,0]  
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```go
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.
```

**Example 3:**

```go
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
