#
# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the
# reversed list.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
#
#
#
# Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively.
# Could you implement both?
#
#
